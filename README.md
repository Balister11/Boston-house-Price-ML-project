# Boston House Price Prediction:
In this Repo , I have done a Project Boston house data set here i have load the data set from sklearn itself .





## Project Overview:

![App Screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*D6s2K1y7kjE14swcgITB1w.png)


Using Sklearn library I loaded the dataset and also check the complete information about the dataset using the same library.
since the data is having no Null values.It become easy for me..

Here complete dataset is in numerical so.It become easy to work on the dataset.


## I am following below Steps :

           - Price Prediction Project:
           - Collect the data
           - Checking the Data information
           - Understand Problem statement 
           - Using matplotlib and Seaborn for data Visualization
           - Scaling
           - varaiable transformation
           - Split the Data
           - Model developement
           - LinearRegression
           - r2_score
           - Read the Model and check once again
           - Using Flask Integrate with HTML and CSS
           - Generate outcome in localhost
           - Deploy in Server
           - API Generation
           - Share our Project API

## why spliting the data:

So here spited the data and balanced the length of X_train,y_train data then apply and develop the model


#### Finally entire data is set ready for Model developement Purpose:
Know I selected LinearRegression for Model developement:

since after training the model I got the results of :

                  - y_train predi : 0.7434997532004697
                  - y_test predi  : 0.7112260057484903
                  - r2_score      : 0.7112260057484903
           

Saving model now.
